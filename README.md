# Excemel: Better XML for JRuby

[![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/integrallis/excemel.png)](https://codeclimate.com/github/integrallis/excemel)

Excemel is a Ruby DSL for Elliotte Rusty Harold's XOM XML library. It is based 
on Jim Weirich's Builder. Excemel brings to JRuby the expressiveness and 
close-to-the-language XML construction features of Builder with the correctness, 
simplicity, and performance of XOM.

Excemel extends the semantics of Builder with methods to navigate the 
in memory XML document with XPath and exposing some of the powerful XML
manipulation capabilities of XOM.
